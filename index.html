    <h2>For Noor-UL-Ain ❤️</h2>
    <p>
My Noor,

Hiii Im sorry   
I really dont know what to say i couldnt think about anything except the fact that you might be mad at me and you dont want to talk to me abhi. And im hoping you 
feel talking to me tomorrow. You are genuinely the best thing to happen to me and i am more than to stop all the talks and save them for later.
      I genuinely just want you and only you. Nothing i say is a lie even if it feels hard to believe 
trust me i wanna treat you with nothing but respect and im more than happy to continue that. 

I really hope you can forgive me because we both know you're not feeling good right now. Trust me im genuinely sorry and i wont ever even mention it again. 
      I guess i got really carried away during our talks. It wont happen again 

      Also im sorry for all the typos and bad grammar and i dont have the ability to capitalise all the I's right now 

      I really really do love you and IM genuinely sorry 
And…

Jaan-e-man                     Jaan-e-Jahan  
Tum sabse haseen          Tum sabse jahan
    </p>

<script>
function openLetter() {
    document.getElementById("envelope").style.display = "none";
    document.getElementById("letter").style.display = "block";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>

THis is the code i've written. i need you to add an animation of hearts as the letter opens and i need you to make it so i can store multiple letters and each of them has a title on them
