    <h2>For Noor-UL-Ain ❤️</h2>
    <p>
My Noor,

Hiii  
You know I have been thinking of writing letters and like give you a shit ton of those when you come to GIKI.  
But yes I’m lazy as hell and I wanted to write something abhi.  
I have zero things to tell you because I tell you all my thoughts as I’m thinking, but yes…

I really love you Noor-UL-Ain.  
You’re literally the most perfect girlfriend.  
You’re the perfect mix.  

And I love the fact that you don’t say no to my dumb ahh requests unless it’s just really outrageous — and it’s justified tbh.  

I really love you.  
All my thoughts have you in them…  
Unless I’m thinking about all the quizzes I have to prepare for, you.

You’re a really fun person to talk to.  
I really like the fact that we met, no matter how it happened or what we had to go through to get here.  
I’m just happy I got you in the end.  
It was the best possible outcome.

I would ask you out every day if I could, only to see a part of that actual smile — if not the entire smile — you had the moment I asked you to date me.

To end this one, I just wanna say I love you to the moon and back.

And…

Jaan-e-man                     Jaan-e-Jahan  
Tum sabse haseen          Tum sabse jahan
